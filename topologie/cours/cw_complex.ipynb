    "The spaces $X^{n-1}$ and $(D_\\alpha^n)_\\alpha$ are epquipped their own topology, then disjoint union and quotient operations induce naturally the topology of the new space. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, $X^{n}$ as a set of equivalent classes over $Y=X^{n-1} \\bigsqcup_\\alpha D_\\alpha^n$, is of complete different nature then $X^{n-1}$. For instance, if $x$ is an element of $X^{n-1} \\setminus \\phi({\\partial D_\\alpha^n})$ then $\\{x\\}$ is an element of $X_n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This complication is however not desired: we would like to talk about $X_{n-1}$ as a subset of $X^n$ as our intuition tells us. A simple way is to instead consider the space $X^n := X^{n-1} \\bigsqcup_\\alpha e_\\alpha^n$ with the topology similar to the quotient topology on $Y/\\sim_n$. Notice that $X^n$ here is on bijection with $Y/\\sim_n$. Consequently, $U \\subset X^n$ is open iff (in the sense of definition) $U \\cap X_{n-1}$ is open and $U\\cap \\overline{e_\\alpha^n}$ is open for each $\\alpha$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe a better way is to take the word \"quotient\" differently. Consider the mapping $q: Y\\to X^n$ which sends the pairs $x\\sim_n \\phi_\\alpha^n(x)$ to $\\phi_\\alpha^n(x)\\in X^{n-1}$ and behaves as identity elsewhere. Then $q$ is a identification map (since $X^n$ is equipped with final topology by $q$). As a consequence $X^n$ is homeomorphic to $Y/\\sim_n$ (see [quotient topology](./quotient_topology.ipynb)). Due to the final topology on $X^n$, $V\\subset X^n$ is open iff $q^{-1}(V)\\cap X^{n-1}$ and $q^{-1}(V)\\cap D_\\alpha^n$ are all open. \n",

With the remark in the previous paragraph, We can see that $\\Phi_\\alpha$ is homeomorphic from $\\mathrm{Int}(D_\\alpha^n)$ to its image in $X$. This image is called a *cell*, and denoted by $e_\\alpha^n$. \n",
