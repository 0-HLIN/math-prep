    "(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $f: I\\to X$ a path in $X$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will borrow the idea of the proof to *Lemma 1.15* in the book, to find a partition $0=s_0<s_1<...<s_m=1$ of $I$ such that each subinterval $[s_{i-1}, s_i]$ is mapped by $f$ to $A_i$ a star-shaped subspace. \n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, let $s\\in I$, then $f(s)\\in X$ has a star-shaped neighborhood $A_{s}$. Then there is an open interval $B_s\\subset \\mathbb{R}$ containing $x$ and $f(\\overline{B_s \\cap I}) \\subset A_s$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Why? There is an open set $V$ of $X$, such that $f(s)\\in V \\subset A_s$. Then $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open set in $I$ containing $s$. There is an open ball (open interval) $B\\subset \\mathbb{R}$ centered at $s$ with $B\\cap I \\subset f^{-1}(V)$. By reducing the radius, we can find a open ball $B_s$ whose the closure is still inside $B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now $\\bigcup_{s\\in I} B_s \\cap I$ is an open cover of $I$. $I$ being compact, we have $\\bigcup_{i=1}^m B_{s_i}\\cap I = I$ for some $s_i$. And endpoints of the intervals $B_{s_i}\\cap I$ define the desired partition of $I$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now it suffices to replace each subpath by a piecewise linear path. The composition will still be piecewise linear since we have only finite subpath to operate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $g_i\\colon I\\to X$ the function defined by $g_i(t):=f(s_{i-1} + (s_{i} - s_{i-1})t)$. We verify it indeed defines a path (continuous) from $f(s_{i-1})$ to $f(s_i)$. By contruction $g(I) = f([s_{i-1}, s_i])$ lies in a star-shaped subset of $X$, with some basepoint $x_0$. In particlar any line segment connecting $x_0$ to a point of $g(I)$ still lies in X. Denote $l_1\\colon I\\to X$ the line segment from $g(0)$ to $x_0$ and $l_2\\colon I\\to X$ from $x_0$ to $g(1)$. Then we can see that the circle $l_1^{-1}gl_2^{-1}$ is nullhomotopic by $f_t\\colon I\\ni s \\mapsto (1-t)(l_1^{-1}gl_2^{-1})(s) + t x_0 \\in X$. \n",
